        Overview:
        <br> This course is one year, full time in our Titanic Quarter Campus.  Many people worry that they are too old to do an Access to University course, or that they will need lots of GCSEs to be accepted.  In fact, there is no upper-age limit, and most Access to University courses require few – if any – prior qualifications, although you may be asked to complete a pre-course assessment.  This course provides an alternative route for mature students wishing to apply for entry to higher education.  Our Access courses are validated by either Queen’s University Belfast (QUB) or Ulster University (UU) and are intensive and challenging and require a high level of commitment to achieve success.  All Access programmes/courses are Level 3 and considered to be equivalent to A level.  Access to University courses are widely recognised by UK Universities and many students successfully progress to a variety of degree courses
